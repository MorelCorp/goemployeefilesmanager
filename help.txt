* authenticate (1st step on any installation)
You first need to get the file credentials.json from your google account becore calling this.
Either you get the credentials.json from your organization or, if you are deploying the app yourself follow the procedure on google site "Getting started with authentication" https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started
That part is a problem because you cannot run oAuth from a dev environment it seems... you need to run it command line.
- go build 
- go run goemployeefilesmanager authenticate
You will be shown a link (https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/aauth?access_type....) click on the link and proceed with the steps provided.
you will be given a key that you'll have to paste on the command line of the running application.
Once you press enter, you'll be prompted by "Saving credential file to: token.json" signifying that you are now successfully authenticated.
